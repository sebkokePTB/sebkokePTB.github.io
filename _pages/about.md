I am a postdoctoral researcher working at the [Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt](https://www.ptb.de/cms/en/ptb/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-43/ag-434.html), the national metrology institude of Germany.
Prior to joining PTB I have been with Innolight GmbH/Coherent LaserSystem GmbH & Co. KG, the [Max Born Institute](https://mbi-berlin.de/about-mbi/organization/division-c-nonlinear-processes-in-condensed-matter), and the [University of MÃ¼nster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.AP/Denz/en/).


Research topics
=====
- optics: interferometry, spectrographs, beam parameter measurements, fibers
- nonlinear optics: solitons, frequency broadening and conversion
- laser physics: mode-locked, single-frequency, q-switched, fiber lasers
- timeseries analysis: statistical properties, search for nonlinear dynamics
- numerical simulation of ODE/PDEs, beam propagation


Academic services
======
I have acted as a journal reviewer (Optics Letters, Optics Express, Optica, Journal of Ligthwave Technology, IEEE UFFC) and helped in conference management (IEEE IFCS-ISAF 2020 (reviewer & session chair)).
